ABOUT: 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Bouncy Balloon is a small game I made with my youngest daughter. It has no external dependencies outside of needing Python 3.7 or higher and the following imports:

 - pygame : a nice game development library for Python
 - random : for random stuff
 - math : needed for math.dist
 - pyglet : a timer that works (note: other high resolution timers cause jerky frame rates)

The entire program is less than 200 lines of code. It is not the smallest game ever in terms of source code, but it is pretty small (by design).

Besides being a fun little game, the point is to help younger programers understand some of the basic components of game design in a readable form.

Now go learn C you script kiddies!

INSTRUCTIONS:
